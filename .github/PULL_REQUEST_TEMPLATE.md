To fail the previous checklist will just delay the approval of your PR.

Notes:
- You should not send changes on files because of spacing or formatting if not intended (avoid unnecessary conflicts).
- The chained PR indication allows the reviewer to know if some PR has to be validated/merged before this one.
- You can help your PR to pass using the right labels (e.g. PCA Review Ready, Ready for Review, etc.)
